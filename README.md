## Getting started
### Prerequisites

You need to write a correct configuration file in order to get that program working. Your configuration file should be placed in `./config/config.yaml`. Here is an exemple of a basic configuration file :
```
port: 8080

database:
  url: "exemple.com"
  user: "user"
  password: "pass_word"
  port: 3306
  dbname: "purplewallet"
```

Once your access to the database are in place from the configuration file, you have to create the database with the name you gave in the configuration file. The tables are going to be created automatically at your first start.

### Installation
